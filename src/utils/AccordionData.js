      content: <div>After you got your tattoo, we advise you to:<br></br>
      - Wash the area daily, it's very important that the area stays clean to allow you skin to heal correctly.<br></br>
      - Keep your skin moisturize, at least 2 to 3 times a day. You should apply a cream with high fat percentage to let the skin heal and avoid it to scab.<br></br>
      - Protect the tattoo form the sun. Apply sunscreen on your tattoo if it can be in direct contact with sunlight.<br></br>
      - It's usually taking the skin 2 to 3 weeks to heal completely (may differ regarding the size and the area), so take good care of it during this period!</div>
